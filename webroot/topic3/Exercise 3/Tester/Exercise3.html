          London is my home
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
          it is full of great architecture all around the city, there are so many
          places to explore that you would think its endless
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
          However there are sites that need a lot of community cleaning, I am mostly
          refering to residential areas
       </p>
        
       <p class="p2">
           The best places to walk are secluded areas with plenty of street light and
           an elegant setting during the night in light rainy days
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
           The worst places to be is in a bus in the summer thats crowded with people
           on a scorching hot day without any ventilation
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
           I recomend anyone who wishes to visit to give it a try!
